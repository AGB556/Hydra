# Hydra
Everyone likes the idea of having a multi color or material printing. The rise of the AMS and other MMU systems, and their success, have shown this. However, with these systems come a lot of waste. This is where the idea of having multiple tooheads on one printer comes into play. This has already been done with commerical printers such as the [Prusa XL](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-xl-semi-assembled-single-toolhead-3d-printer/) and its up to 5 head setup, or the [SVO4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSZyKt1o3CQ) and its IDEX setup with 2 seperate toolheads. However, both have their own limitations. The Prusa XL 5 Head costs $4,000 and the SV04 is both not as fast as other options on the market, as well as many years out of date. There are other custom options such as [Stealthchanger](https://github.com/DraftShift/StealthChanger?tab=readme-ov-file), but those require a printer like the Voron 2.4 that will run your close to a grand just for the base printer. This is where the idea of Hydra was born. 

I have long been interested in multi color and material printing, partcularily with a custom toolchanger. The flexibility it gives you, along with the coolness factor is hard to beat with anything else.

Hydra is a toolchanger printer with currently support for 5 toolheads for filament and 1 toolhead for automatic bed leveling. It uses a CoreXY kinematic system, along with triple z leadscrew with a kinematic bed based off the [RatRig V-Core 3.1](https://docs.ratrig.com/product-details/v-core3-1), and a custom toolchanging system with inspiration taken from [WP-DAKSH Toolchanger](https://github.com/ankurv2k6/wp-daksh-toolchanger/tree/main). The overall current build volume is 310mm x 310mm x 250mm. The current version is not enclosed, however, it is pretty easy to add on panels to at least partially enclose the system. 

Project Goals:

 - Create a cheap, effective toolchanger
 - Large build volume
 - Bambu Lab level speeds
 - Heated Bed
 - Rigid Frame

At this current point in time, assuming you have no tools, wire, hardware, or anything of the sort, the current BOM is $563.58 pre tax and pre shipping.
