I set up my repo, the onshape docs, and the other documents I am using to track my research. I also will make a pr on the hack club github once my project is approved.

I am planning to start off my doing some drawing and idea generation using paper and MS Paint, after which I will go into CAD and start laying everything out.

After talking with one of my robotic mentors, I determined a few crucial details that will help move my design forwards. I looked at the Bambu Lab X1C and found out that they only used 1 stepper motor to drive the z axis using a timing belt. This was huge as it means I can get away with a [BTT Octopus Pro 1.1 Board](https://biqu.equipment/products/bigtreetech-octopus-pro-v1-0-chip-f446?variant=40144816767074) with 8 stepper drivers. This allows me to use 1 motor on z, 1 on A, 1 on B, and then have 5 slots left over for 5 toolheads! I was originally worried about having enough slots as I had already thought about multiple motors for z, but this solves all of my issues! I have put the picture of the Bambu and a drawing below.

This allows me to have up to FIVE toolheads on the printer! While also simplifying my z axis and making it super simple. Now it is time to go to some simple sketches in Onshape to begin the process.

I started my CAD work to knock out some general sizes from which i will design the rest of the printer.

The idea here is that I have 5 bays for each toolhead, each of which I am aiming to have be less than 2.5in wide. In the picture above, I drew what I mean. My goal is to have the fan and duct for part cooling will stay on the toolhead to reduce complexity and part count. Then, the extruder/nozzle will swap in and out. I can forsee a potential problem later on with wiring, but that is a later me issue. The hardest part is going to be figureing out a secure way to actually change between the toolheads, as since I am not using a flying gantry, the latching system is going to be a little harder as there are very few examples for that to go off of. I have a few ideas to make it work, but I want to dive a little deeper into them before I flesh them out in CAD.

Other than that, I started my mastersketch for the frame, from which I will derive the 3D CAD from such that I can easily adjust dimensions if I need more speed. Here is the general idae for how space will be laid out.
