I set up my repo, the onshape docs, and the other documents I am using to track my research. I also will make a pr on the hack club github once my project is approved.

I am planning to start off my doing some drawing and idea generation using paper and MS Paint, after which I will go into CAD and start laying everything out. 

Time Spent: 15 Minutes

After talking with one of my robotic mentors, I determined a few crucial details that will help move my design forwards. I looked at the Bambu Lab X1C and found out that they only used 1 stepper motor to drive the z axis using a timing belt. This was huge as it means I can get away with a [BTT Octopus Pro 1.1 Board](https://biqu.equipment/products/bigtreetech-octopus-pro-v1-0-chip-f446?variant=40144816767074) with 8 stepper drivers. This allows me to use 1 motor on z, 1 on A, 1 on B, and then have 5 slots left over for 5 toolheads! I was originally worried about having enough slots as I had already thought about multiple motors for z, but this solves all of my issues! I have put the picture of the Bambu and a drawing below.

This allows me to have up to FIVE toolheads on the printer! While also simplifying my z axis and making it super simple.
